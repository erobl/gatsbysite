This is the first post for this blog, as well as test for the features in this
blog, powered by [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org).

# Header 1

This one will probably never be used, as it has the same weight as the main title.

## Header 2

Much reasonable for subheaders.

### Header 3

It's nice too

#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
At this point the header is smaller than text.

<div style="color:#FF0000">arbitrary html</div>

Math works too! Both inline, $ \int_0^t f(s) ds $ and block 
$$
f(x) = x
$$
are supported by $\KaTeX$.

Inline code `a >>= b` and block code,
```haskell
>>=  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

m >>= f  =  join $ fmap f m
```

with javascript syntax highlighting
```javascript
function hello(world) {
    console.log(world)
}
```

it also supports funny pictures!
